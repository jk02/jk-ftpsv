Practice FTP server for educational purposes

Currently, the server just allows connections over TELNET and will note any messages sent to it.  The plan is to turn the TELNET socket into a control channel for an FTP server, which will provide basic functionality in accordance with IETF RFC 959 (at least, that's the ultimate goal!)

This is just a self study project with no intention of being used in a production setting.  The code is purely for educational benefit (see LICENSE for more details.)
